<h1>Solutions for Logistics and Transportation Providers</h1>
<p>The global economy has evolved from just logistics to x-shoring, omni-channel business models, global transportation requirements and energy efficient supply chains. Today, transportation and logistics services providers face a new set of challenges:</p>
<ul >
  <li>Focus on the Internet of Moving Things (IoMT) with every freight- and passenger-carrying vehicle envisaged to be in real time communication with distributed cloud-enabled network control centers</li>
  <li>Widespread adoption of APIs and web service integration for flexible, dynamic and collaborative business models</li>
  <li>Event handling and analytics for self-corrective and intelligent disruption of management processes</li>
</ul>


<p>It is imperative for logistics and transportation service providers to have a transparent view of their supply chains, systems and process to cater to omni-channel business models and drive business and operational efficiency to stay competitive. In their quest to reduce infrastructure costs, mainframe-based logistics businesses are seeking to move certain functions to new generation multi-tiered API-based architecture with a responsive Web UI. Legacy digitization initiatives are helping deliver personalized information to new gen employee and customer devices, enhancing their overall interaction experience.</p>
