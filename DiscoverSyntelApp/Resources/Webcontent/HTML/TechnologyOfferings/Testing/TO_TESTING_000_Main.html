			<h2>Experience “Quality with Speed” with Syntel’s Continuous Testing Services</h2>
<p>The Digital Age is transforming virtually every business with new technologies, new market dynamics, and customers who demand new services delivered anytime-anywhere with a seamless brand experience. Clearly, today’s enterprises need to upgrade their IT landscapes to keep pace with the rapidly changing digital economy.</p>
<p >Most traditional QA models are reactive in nature, and struggle to provide the necessary speed to market while keeping quality high. With increasingly complex applications, multiple touchpoints and a fragmented device landscape, Digital Age testing needs to be done earlier, more often and more efficiently.</p>
<p >Fortunately, Syntel’s Testing Services have been designed to deliver outstanding value and a rich customer experience to enterprises by delivering <b>QUALITY with SPEED</b>.</p>
