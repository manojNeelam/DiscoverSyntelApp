			<Title>BPOs add higher value services to their portfolio to beat growth stagnation</Title>
			<Description>Faced with the chilly wind of margin declines and slower growth, Indian outsourcing firms are looking to add higher value services to their portfolio even as they move more work to smaller towns and cities to cut costs. Pricing troubles in the sector began in 2006 with the entry of numerous players and came to a head in 2008 after the global economic crisis which saw salary levels in the West drop, reducing the gap with what is paid in India.</Description>

          <Description>One of the world's top 10 global medical devices and pharmaceutical manufacturers was looking for prospective and retrospective validation of Commercial off-the Shelf (COTS) software tools used by their research department. The US Food Drug Administration (USFDA) has stringent guidelines for Computer Systems Validations (CSV). Successful validation demands that a number of underlying supporting processes are satisfactorily met. These processes include document management, change control, configuration management, requirements traceability, self-inspections and training. These procedures make the process critical as well as important. Syntel�s unique risk based frameworks and methodologies, coupled with customized tools and accelerators, contributed to quality compliance, productivity and efficiency.</Description>

			<Description>Due to variety of market pressures, today's enterprises are looking beyond IT outsourcing to find additional ways to realize cost reductions and enterprise-wide improvements. Many companies are turning to business process outsourcing (BPO) to address these issues. However, business process outsourcing projects can prove disastrous unless companies select processes suitable for developing or maintaining at a remote site, whether domestically or internationally. Yet most companies are challenged to identify and evaluate issues concerning what, how, and where to outsource.</Description>

			<Description>In most private cloud implementation scenarios we came across IaaS (Infrastructure as a Solution) as the sole way of implementing cloud. In IaaS, the concept of very high scalability, reliability, availability and on demand provisioning is limited to hardware/virtual machines. Though implementing IaaS qualifies an organization to call itself "cloud-enabled," there needs to be a PaaS (Platform as a Service) that augments the cloud efficiency to maximize return on investment and propel the organization further into the cloud maturity index.</Description>

The US Food Drug Administration (USFDA) has stringent guidelines for Computer Systems Validations (CSV).
